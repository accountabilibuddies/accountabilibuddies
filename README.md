# Group Project - *Accountabilibuddies*

## Description

Help one another find motivation to achieve goals.

You can link up with someone from your contact list to set and complete personal goals. Your ‘accountabilibuddy’ can be a stranger who has similar goals (e.g., two people who like to paint) or someone in your contacts list. You provide evidence of the steps you take to achieve the goal and share with your accountabilibuddies.
